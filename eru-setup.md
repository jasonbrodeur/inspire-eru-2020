# ERU - Pre-module setup

Hello, everyone and thanks for enrolling in **Electronics for the Rest of Us!**. I'm looking forward to working with you all over the next week or so. 

In preparation for next week's module, there is a small amount of pre-module activities that I'm asking you to carry out before the first class on Tuesday. This will ensure that you have all of the software and materials you need for the module, and will give us time to troubleshoot issues before you're scheduled to start working. 

You're asked to complete the following steps: 
1. Verify that your kit arrived in the mail. If you've not received your kit by Friday, 15-May, please contact me via Avenue to Learn
2. Install the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) software on the computer you'll use for this module. 
  - Go to the Arduino [download page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and download the Arduino IDE (version 1.8.12) that corresponds to your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux). **Be sure to download the Arduino IDE and not the Web Editor.**
    - If you have a Chromebook that you need to use, contact Jay via Avenue to Learn so that we can test the web editor for your purposes.
  - Install the IDE on your computer.
3. If you don't already have one, create a GitHub account at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/). We'll be using GitHub to share and store files, and to host your final project website using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
4. Once you've created and verified your GitHub account, follow [this link]() to create the repository that you'll use for the module. 

If you experience difficulties at any point, please contact Jay through Avenue to Learn.
